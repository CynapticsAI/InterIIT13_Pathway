Security breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or\nhardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated, making it more\ndifficult to successfully detect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. Cyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become\nmore prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if\nrestoring from backups is delayed or not feasible. Threat actors, sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-\nattacks. Due to increasing geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may\nbe vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products. Furthermore, we rely\non products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based\ninfrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other\nbusiness disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners\u2019 supply chains have not been\ncompromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology\nsystems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. Our ability to monitor\nthese third parties\u2019 information security practices is limited, and these may not have adequate information security measures in place. In\naddition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security breach, our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have\ndirect access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security breach. Additionally, we are incorporated into the supply chain of\na large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or services are compromised, a significant number of our customers and\ntheir data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm our business. To defend against cyber-attacks, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is\nexpected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security measures, ensure our suppliers have appropriate\nsecurity measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers, applicable industry standards, and\ngovernment regulations. While we take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have identified, we may not always be able\nto detect all vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and\ntechniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred.

These changes, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for\nincome taxes, results of operations and financial condition. Our future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings\nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, the expiration of statute of limitations and\nsettlements of tax audits, changes in accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses\nnot deductible for tax purposes, the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax valuation allowances, changing\ninterpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business combinations, as well as changes in the domestic or\ninternational organization of our business and structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in\nour stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur. A decline in our stock price may result in reduced\nfuture tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate, and adversely affect our financial results.

For example, we are defending on appeal the dismissal of a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting\nclaims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency\nmining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur,\nincluding monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business\npractices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material\nadverse impact. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from implementing our\nstrategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. As of January 29, 2023, we had outstanding a total of $11 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior notes matures, unless redeemed\nor repurchased, we must repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to refinance, we may receive less favorable terms, or we may be unable to\nrefinance at all, which may adversely affect our financial condition. We also have a $575 million commercial paper program. Maintenance of our current and future indebtedness and contractual restrictions could cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash\nflows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general\neconomic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our flexibility regarding changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain\nfuture financing; and restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of our assets, or materially change our\nbusiness. Our ability to comply with the covenants in our indenture may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants\nwithout a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. Changes\nto our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities, restrict our ability to obtain future financing and affect the terms\nof any such financing. Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control. The anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control. Provisions in our\ncertificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock. These\nprovisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend\nor repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or call special meetings;\nadvance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some\nprovisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our agreement with Microsoft for the Xbox, if someone makes an offer to\npurchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. These\nprovisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect\ndirectors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.

Inventory provisions for excess inventory and purchase obligations\ntotaled $2.17 billion in fiscal year 2023. We may incur inventory provisions if our inventory or supply commitments are misaligned with demand\nfor our products. Product transitions are complex as we often ship both new and legacy architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners\nprepare to ship and support new products. We are currently transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and\nGaming products. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel\ninventory of legacy architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. While we have managed\nprior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult and prior trends\nmay not continue. We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist. Examples include our Omniverse\nplatform and third-party large language models and generative models. Our demand estimates for these use cases and applications can be\nincorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate any revenue from these use cases and\napplications. NVIDIA AI Cloud Service Offerings\nWe will offer enterprise customers NVIDIA AI cloud services directly and through our network of partners. Examples of these services include\nNVIDIA DGX Cloud, which is cloud-based infrastructure and software for training AI models, and customizable pretrained AI models.

Our results and competitive position may be\nharmed if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative product offerings, if customers purchase product from competitors, or if\ncustomers develop their own internal solution, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers,\nor if we incur significant transition costs. COVID-19\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we reopened our offices worldwide. We incurred incremental expenses and related in-office costs as we ramped onsite\nservices. Restrictions may be imposed or reinstated as the pandemic resurfaces, such as lockdown measures due to COVID-19 containment efforts in\nChina. During fiscal year 2023, end customer sales for our products in China have been negatively impacted by lockdowns and this impact may\ncontinue if lockdowns return. COVID-19-related disruptions have created and may continue to create supply chain and logistics constraints. Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis.

Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are\nperformed.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as our sales are in United States dollars and foreign\ncurrency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign currency exchange rate movements. Gains or losses from foreign currency\nremeasurement are included in other income or expense. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net\nincome was not significant for fiscal years 2023 and 2022. Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject\nto exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States\u2019 dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more\nexpensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States\u2019 dollar relative to other\ncurrencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international\noperations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely\naffected by a weaker dollar. The primary currency we hedge is Israeli Shekel. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We\ndesignate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses\non the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related\noperating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are\ndenominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the\nchange in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign\ncurrency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $112 million and $103 million lower,\nrespectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change\nin hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized. If an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse\nimpact on income before taxes of approximately $36 million and $41 million as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, respectively. These\nchanges in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency\ndenominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and\nliabilities balances.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures\nor our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the\nfact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and\nwhether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or\nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical\naudit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which\nit relates. Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-\ndown inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of the Company\u2019s inventory provisions\nrelate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company\u2019s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to\nassumptions about future demand and market conditions. As of January 29, 2023, the Company\u2019s consolidated inventories balance was $5,159\nmillion and the Company\u2019s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations balance was $4,920 million, of which a\nsignificant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions\nfor excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by\nmanagement when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing\nassumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing\nprocedures and evaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s provisions for\nexcess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including controls over management\u2019s assumptions related to future\ndemand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\u2019s process for developing the provisions for\nexcess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s approach; testing\nthe completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s assumptions\nrelated to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions\ninvolved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical\nproduct life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 24, 2023\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2004.",

If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation,\ninvestigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP.",

        "chunk": "However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates,\nwhich could require us to record additional costs. Foreign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured\ninto United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are\nremeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for\nthose expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from\nforeign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant. Income Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal\nyear by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax\neffects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the\namount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the\napplication of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to\nan anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes\nin other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our\nestimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if\nthe recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax\nexpense in our financial statements accordingly. As of January 29, 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.48 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, state, and certain other deferred tax\nassets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains,\ntax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership\nchanges. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an\nincome tax benefit during the period.",

Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income\ntax expense. Net Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period,\nusing the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of\ndiluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of\npurchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months\nwhen purchased. We currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current\noperations. We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These\navailable-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders\u2019 equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes\naccrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and\nrecorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is\nless than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost\nbasis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their\nrelatively short maturities as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that\nare reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component\nof shareholders\u2019 equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments\nare recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends\non the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or\nlosses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk\nbeing hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is\ninitially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure\nis recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Concentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and\naccounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type\nand credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration.",
